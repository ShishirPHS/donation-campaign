# Join our donation campaign

This project is a React application that utilizes React Router for navigation. It consists of three main pages: Home, Donation, and Statistics. The primary purpose of this application is to provide users a platform to make donations.

## Features

- **React Router**: The application uses React Router to handle navigation between pages.

- **Search Functionality**: Users can easily search for donations by category. This feature simplifies the process of finding causes that align with their interests and allows them to make targeted contributions to the areas they care about most. The search functionality enhances the user experience by providing a convenient way to filter and discover donation opportunities based on specific categories, ensuring that users can quickly locate and support the causes that matter most to them.

- **Dynamic Route for Card Details**: When a user selects a card from the Home Page, they are redirected to a dynamic route that displays detailed information about the selected cause or organization. This feature enhances the user experience by allowing users to explore in-depth information, such as the mission, impact, and history of the selected cause.

- **Donation Confirmation Notification**: When a user successfully makes a donation on the Donation Page, they receive a confirmation notification.

- **Duplicate Donation Error Handling**: To prevent accidental duplicate donations, the application includes error handling. If a user attempts to make a donation for the same cause or organization more than once, they will receive an error notification.

- **Donation History Tracking**: On the Donation Page, users can see donation history.

- **Pie Chart**: On the Statistics Page, users can view a pie chart that provides comparison between the total donation and user's donation.
